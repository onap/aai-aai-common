/*
 * The purpose of this class is to be a tool for
 * manually applying jetty obfuscation/deobfuscation
 * so that one can obfuscate the various passwords/secrets
 * in aaiconfig.properties.
 * 
 * Originally, they were being encrypted by a similar
 * command line utility, however the encryption key
 * was being hardcoded in the src package
 * which is a security violation.
 * Since this ultimately just moved the problem of how
 * to hide secrets to a different secret in a different file, 
 * and since that encryption was really just being done to
 * obfuscate those values in case someone needed to look at
 * properties with others looking at their screen,
 * we decided that jetty obfuscation would be adequate
 * for that task as well as
 * removing the "turtles all the way down" secret-to-hide-
 * the-secret-to-hide-the-secret problem.
