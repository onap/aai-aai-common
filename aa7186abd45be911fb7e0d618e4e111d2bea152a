      "message": "~~I don\u0027t think we should name this `service` when the class is actually about exposing configuration.\nAs such I would suggest to rename this to `DeltaEventsConfiguration` with a `@Configuration` annotation~~\nEdit: After thinking this further, we could also just make the `DeltaEventsConfig` class that you are constructing here an `@Configuration` bean, which would make this class obsolete.\nThen you could directly autowire that in the `NotificationService` instead of going through this additional class",
