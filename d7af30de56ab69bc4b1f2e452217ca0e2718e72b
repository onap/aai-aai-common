      "message": "@James you\u0027re correct it\u0027s not specific enough. In fact the TZ database has deprecated US/Michigan and America/Michigan is not a valid TZ.\n\nIt should be America/Detroit for ET or America/Menominee for the Wisconsin border of Michigan. So... what TZ are you in?\n\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones",

I have confirmation from Steve that is OK being removed.",
